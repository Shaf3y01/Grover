# Grover
Showcasing Grover     A Landing page for a grocery delivery service that's designed to be mobile first with Responsive Web Design. I wanted to test out my Grid/FlexBox Skills. Written in plain HTML/CSS/JS. I learned how to animate/resize/fill SVG icons, and used other icons from Font-Awesome. I used Media Queries to help me mentain responsiveness.
